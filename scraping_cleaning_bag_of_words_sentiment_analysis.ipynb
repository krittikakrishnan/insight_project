But... any opinions and experiences to share in the meantime? \",\n",

On August 17th I ran out of birth control and couldn't get more until that friday so I removed my patch. On Friday morning I got my patches (Ortho evra) and was sent on my way being told I needed to reset my patch day and I might have a light period. We were also told to use condoms for the next week which we did. On August 24th I started having some light brown discharge this happened for two days. Then from friday August 26- that sunday I had fairly heavy (enough for me to need to wash my underwear now :P ) dark brown discharge and saw it every time I went to the Ladies room. Every once in awhile I'd have light spotting (blood light red) and some cramping. The discharge is not normal for me I have never had that before or during a period nor did I have that the first time I ever got my period.\\n\\nSince Sunday it's been off and on a little light discharge here of brown and a little of blood. This is now Wednesday and today I was at work and in the three hours I was there I had to pee 6times and had some more pain/cramping. I didn't have anything to drink today so this makes no sense to me. I got over my UTI that I had so I don't think it's that plus i don't have any other UTI symptoms.I don't know what's going on or if this is normal but it sure as hell isn't normal for me nor did they warn me of anything like this. \\n\\nAnybody have any ideas? I'm just curious as to how the internet feels. I am going to go to Planned Parenthood no matter what and i appreciate any and all input. Just please don't harp on it being a UTI I can tell you without a doubt that mine is gone.\",\n",

My strange, stubborn insurance plan will only allow me to pick up one month's worth of pills at a time--and as much as I'd like to make my mother mail me a new pack every new month, I'm not sure the cost of postage justifies it.\\n\\nIdeally, I'd love to just transfer my prescription to a UK pharmacy (I'm gonna miss you, Rite Aid), or failing that, head to my university clinic and request a new Rx for Aviane. I'm not sure how viable either option will be, especially because Wikipedia tells me that everyday regimens (with a week of placebo pills) aren't frequently prescribed in the UK. I'd prefer not to change to an entirely different chemical formulation, but I'll likely be in a LDR and so needing a little time to switch won't be a huge deal.\\n\\nSo, internationally savvy/British ladies: does anyone know if Aviane (20 µg ethinyl estradiol/100 µg levonorgestrel, also sold in the US as Alesse, Lessina, Lutera, and Sronyx) or a chemical equivalent is available in the UK? I'd also love to hear any advice about making a switch (if necessary), any recommendations for new brands, or any similar experiences you may have had.\\n\\nMy baby-free uterus and I offer our thanks in advance!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"My husband and I are not looking forward to making any babies for at least a couple more years, so I'd like to find a birth control method we can agree on. Let me preface this post with the fact that I know all methods work differently with different people. Anyway.\\n\\nI've only ever tried a few different pills. One I can't remember the name of, but it was from PP, and it gave me nausea and vomiting, so I quit taking it after a couple months. Next, I was involved in a clinical research study that gave me pills for a year, and they were the most amazing things ever. No side effects whatsoever, only 4 periods a year, and they were free! But the study ended, so I had to figure out what I wanted next.\\n\\nSince I really enjoyed the freedom of rare periods, I decided to try out Seasonique. Oh boy. I have acne worse than I ever had as a teenager (I'm in my early 20's now). I also have super lowered libido, which has been an increasing problem since first trying BC pills. Not to mention my depression has greatly increased since starting Seasonique. I've also got crappy mood swings and irritability. Oh, and there's the fact that it costs $300 per pack without insurance! I've been on it for six months now, and am just looking for something else.\\n\\nI made myself an establishing GYN appointment for later this month. I wanted to discuss options such as the shot, as well as possibly get tested for hormone levels that could be effecting my libido, and maybe even go on antidepressants. But after extensive reading, I just really don't want all these drugs in my system. Take medicine so I can have sex whenever I want, but I never want sex. Take medicine to fix the mental instability that the other medicine exacerbates. Feh, seems a little silly to me.\\n\\nOn that note, I'd like something non-hormonal. I'm pretty sure all my symptoms are related to all these extra hormones I've got running through me. My husband for sure doesn't want to do condoms, so that's out. Paragard has definitely piqued my interest, but I'm not sure if I've got the girl-balls to go through with the procedure. I have a friend who tried to get an IUD and said it was the worst thing ever. My other consideration is to just get some sort of app (or [CycleBeads](http://www.cyclebeads.com/)?) that shows me when I'm fertile, and just use withdrawl method during those days.\\n\\nCan someone point me in the right direction, give me anecdotes of your own experiences, or something? I am so sick of reading about birth control at this point. It shouldn't be this hard to not have a baby.\\n\\n**TL;DR** Paragard vs. natural cycle tracking vs. something else? Don't want hormones, kthx.\\n\\n**EDIT** Forgot to mention, I use the DivaCup during heavy flow days. Could I still use it with an IUD? And as far as allergies go, I'm not allergic to copper, but I have a slight allergy to nickel. Would that be a problem?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Quick background: So I have several chronic conditions - lupus, fibromyalgia, sjogrens, and a few others. In December, after having super irregular periods and weird symptoms for several years I was told that I had \"unexplained infertility\" and that if I wanted to have kids I would have to have medical assistance.  I came to terms with it and my husband and I decided we didn\\'t really want kids at this point in time, if ever.  Starting in March, however, all of a sudden I had my period every 28-29 days like clockwork.  New theory is that I\\'m fertile.\\n\\nNow onto the vent: This summer I was being treated with low-dose chemotherapy for my many conditions.  Because I was told I was fertile, i wanted to get on some form of BC to ensure I didn\\'t get pregnant while on chemo. I see an ob/gyn, tell her all the medical history, and she prescribes a particular BC pill.  On Saturday, said doctor was speaking at a conference I organized, and as part of her presentation she clearly said that anyone with active lupus (among other things) should not be on ANY hormonal BC.  Um....thanks for telling me.  I\\'m guessing that\\'s why I felt like crap for the last month.  I\\'m obviously not comfortable going back to her, and am at a loss as to finding a good ob/gyn. \\n\\nTL;DR My ob/gyn prescribed a specific BC for me.  Turns out that it was not good for me to take given my health conditions, and I found out this info listening to her giving a talk on Saturday. ',\n",

What I hated was that it depleted calcium levels in my bones and I had to go in every 3 months.\\n\\nAt 18, I switched to Implanon. It is a similar hormone. This meant that it was an easy transition. No bleeding, but still the spotting twice a year or so. The insertion was easy, the numb-er hurt the most (like a bee sting) and I only felt the pressure of the rod being put in. I had some bruising on my arm, but it went away within a week. \\n\\nNow, my mood is normal. My sex drive is normal. Only people that I want to know can tell I'm on it (you can feel it slightly though the skin). It lasts for 3 years, at which point I can go in and get a new one! They say that you can get pregnant within a week of taking it out, so if you are ready for children, it is quickly possible! \\n\\nI guess the best thing is to ask your doctor about the pro's and con's of each birth control! And always, use a condom if you are with a new partner, just in case they have something!\\n\\nWhat works for you?

       "   'selftext': 'Alright so here\\'s some details.\\n\\nI tried a generic BC (Sprintec) for a few months (September to February) that was prescribed by my doctor. I noticed my hormones were all out of what and my sex drive was about half of what it used to be. Also, I\\'m likely the most forgetful person in the world and remembering to take \"my medicine\" every morning was primarily reliant on my SO giving consistent reminders. \\n\\nI am 22 years old and I had a miscarriage 2 years ago.\\n\\nI have ridiculous cramping on my period without taking anything, to the point where I have to come home from work or try my best to plan ahead and ask for days off. Also, nausea and vomiting, to the point that I hardly (even afraid) to eat anything the first four days. \\n\\nI just found out that I am still covered under my family\\'s insurance plan: doctors, specialists, and prescriptions. \\n\\nThen I started seeing talk (Reddit/commercials) about Mirena and other IUDs and to me, it seemed like a perfect solution, until I heard all the negativity that surrounds it. So I\\'ve got some questions.\\n\\n1. For anyone who has one, what is the cost and does insurance cover any of it?\\n\\n2. I\\'ve read in places that Mirena is designed for people who have already had a child. Does anyone know if my past miscarriage will cause any problems, or benefits?\\n\\n3. How much (if measurable) does it effect hormones and sex drive? (When I was on the pill, I had a consistent, mild depression/anger issue, and a very low sex drive.\\n\\n4. General yay or nay from the BC community here. \\n\\n5. How to go about finding and convincing a doctor that I should have this. I\\'m in a brand new town, and have pretty much only used the family doctor up until now. (Moved away from home indefinitely last year.)\\n\\n**tl;dr: Thinking about an IUD, need as much feedback as possible.**',\n",

I tried tri sprintec first, bc it was super cheap... the changing level of hormones each week destroyed my body and made me crazy! My doc gave me a sample pack of Generess and I just finished my first month of it. Being on a monophasic pill has made a huge difference in my mood, but I've been crazy bloated all month and gained like 8 pounds in three weeks. Eeek. I was curious if any one else on here has tried it and if so, what you thought of it. Even if you haven't tried it could you maybe recommend a pill you've tried that you've loved? Yasmin killed my sex drive and I know a couple girls that have gotten blood clots while on it, so I'd prefer not to go back on that if I don't have to! I really appreciate your input and help :) thanks a ton!! \",\n",

On TS, I didn't notice much change in my cycle, which has always been on time, but heavy and with a lot of cramping.  My gyno switched me to LO because it works better with regulation.  But, I'm at the end of my placebo week, and I still haven't had my period.  Is this normal?  I had unprotected sex twice--after the first two weeks on LO--and I'm a worried that I'm part of the 1%...pregnant while taking the pill.\\n\\nThoughts?\",\n",

I understand that there is a very small fail rate, and that I shouldn't be too worried, but I am. \\n\\nIs this morning sickness? Should we be taking a test to be sure? And since I'm here, a while back she got some bleeding and spotting. Can someone explain exactly what this is? I thought depo prevented all this, so I am a bit confused, and is really why I'm worrying now. From what I've read, the shot stops the ovaries from releasing an egg and also thins the lining in the uterus. So how could she have gotten a period? Does this mean that she did release an egg? Does this mean that I could have gotten her pregnant?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I’m writing this on behalf of my friend who, as of 6 months ago, lives and works in North Africa.  We grew up where birth control was readily available and information was easy to access. She is now in a country where it is shameful to discuss or use and taboo at best. She had a pregnancy scare recently and was scared that not only, might she be pregnant to a new boy friend far from home, but that the anti-malaria medication that she has been on (she has had malaria five times in the last six months) would mean that any potential child has a good chance of having a foot growing out of its head due to the malaria meds.  She is on the pill (obtained from Europe on a stopover) and very strict on taking it, but the regular vomiting and diarrhea (food and water cleanliness issues too) mean that she could be at greater risk of falling preggers than if she was regularly healthy.  If she did find herself pregnant or possibly pregnant again (She absolutely does not want this to happen, but she wants to be prepared...) where is the nearest country that she could travel to, to get the abortion pill or a termination? My Google-fu has the answer at South Africa thus far, she is afraid to Google due to being busted searching for such a thing at work (no home internet available).  She and I have agreed that condoms are the most reliable form of contraception and the obvious choice, but knowing where this other option could be sourced from would be handy to know too.  Thank you in advance for your help everyone! PM me if you don’t want to respond to this in a public forum.  Thank you!',\n",

I never PMS either.  \\n\\nAlso, I don't know if this is because I'm new to sex, but I can't get/stay in the mood or wet enough for long. Then again, my bf and I are LDR, so we get to see each other maybe twice a month. Didn't know if this would be a factor.\\n\\nShould I talk to my doctor about switching? Or should I just come off altogether? Or is there any way to help the low libido/PMS-like symptoms without coming off of it? I love the convenience of not having to remember to take pills or worry about condoms, but I'm feeling awful.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hey guys (or rather...girls!) I'm planning to make an appointment to talk to my doctor soon, but I'm looking into other forms of birth control (specifically a copper IUD) and I'm having trouble finding any conclusive and helpful answers on the internets.\\n\\nI have always had really horrible, painful cramps during my period that would often keep me out of school for a day or two every month. When I was 15, my doctor finally put me on the BCP and I stayed on it until I was 19.\\n\\nI took a couple different kinds and brands of BCP over the years, but by the time I was about 19 I started to feel that the constant mood swings and emotional problems I was having were linked to my pill, as well as some annoying side effects (like migraines). As an experiment, I went off of it for a few months (I wasn't sexually active at the time) and found that my moods improved, and my period/cramps where more manageable even without the hormones. Everything returned to normal, sans pill.\\n\\nThree years later, I am now in a relationship. We decided it was a good idea for me to go back on the pill to ensure non-pregnancy, so I got a prescription from my doctor, and picked up where I'd left off...same type of pill and everything. It's been about three months, and all the emotional problems came back even worse than I remember them being. I feel emotionally neutralized most of the time. My sex drive is very low, and I will occasionally have long depressive states or random bursts of emotion wherein I start sobbing over nothing or get super anxious for no reason. The non-babyness is a pro, and I really like having so much control over my period, but I miss feeling the fluctuations in my cycle, and, well, not being a crazy emotional mess 90% of the time.\\n\\nI noticed that a lot of people recommend a copper IUD for people who are having problems with or don't like hormonal birth control. It sounds great, but I also hear so many horror stories about heavy periods and awful cramping with a copper IUD, and I don't want to have to go through that again every month. I'm trying to figure out if it's worth making the appointment and talking to my doctor about it, or if there are any other options you think I should consider. \\n\\nSorry if this post was a little lengthy, I just feel like it's important to know some of my background with birth control.\",\n",

For the first couple of months I had some spotting, but then my period stopped completely and I haven't had it since. About two weeks ago I noticed my nipples were really sore and sensitive. I thought it was from le sexytimes, but they were sore even days after some relatively mild play. About a week after they started to hurt my cervix felt extremely sensitive during sex. It was okay at first, but towards the end it hurt so bad we had to stop and I was in so much pain for the next hour I just laid in bed pathetically and cried out of fear and pain. Since then I've had some weird uterus pains that come and go, almost like spasms. This morning I woke up and I was bleeding. It was so unexpected I had to go to the store for tampons and teach myself how to do it again. Immediately after the sore cervix I took a pregnancy test because it was unusual. It was negative, and a few days later I took another that was also negative. I don't have insurance so my school's clinic couldn't do much besides a doctor pressing on my stomach and telling me everything seemed normal. Has anyone gone through something similar? Even though the pregnancy tests have come back negative I still feel anxious about the possibility and generally a little bit stressed out that my body is being so weird. \",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nNever posted in /r/birthcontrol before, so hi there everyone. My Mirena has expired and I've been looking for a new birth control method. I can't do pills because I'm special in the head and I'll forget, condoms I don't trust because they aren't reliable as a full time birth control. Mostly because my husband and I will...get into it and not always use them. I don't like the nuvaring method either just because the idea that it's just kinda in there scares me. Also won't do the patch because I don't trust it. Really I'm down to a few things with that. \\n\\nI could do another IUC/IUD but I'd like to steer away from that because it's got the placement strings and they tend to poke my husband (they have been trimmed as far as they can be without interfering with my self examinations) I've looked at the shots and implanon, I really like the idea of the implanon, it's discreet and kinda outta sight outta mind. I've never had any ill side effects from my Mirena other than a few mild ovarian cysts one of which ruptured, but that is common. No mood swings, my period disappeared, no weight gain on it. I was pretty much good. \\n\\nMy big question I guess is has anyone tried the implanon and if so what were any ill side effects or benefits you found with it. If there were any ill side effects is it anything you've had problems with prior to insertion? Also any suggestions as to any other kinds of BC I've not considered so far that's always welcome.  Also if you've tried the implanon how restricted is your arm movement after insertion? I do physicial work and while I don't lift anything heavy I do lift bend and use the arm I'd have it put in repetitively all day and I can't take time off work. \\n\\nThanks for any suggestions/feedback. \",\n",

When I started my new pill pack this week, the pharmacy has switched me to Syeda. Problem is HIVES. Lots of them. From my neck to my toes. Thank goodness there's only one very small one on my face. This is day four of hives. Is it possible that I could be allergic to the new generic? Aren't they all the same formulation, just different brands? I called my doctor's office and the nurse practitioner suggested I go to an urgent care or ER and get a steroid shot. I'm not sure if that's necessary if I just stop taking the pills (and not have sex in the meantime...) My doctor wasn't in today so I won't be able to get a new RX until Monday. The nurse practitioner and I ruled out any form of contact dermatitis from new perfumes, soaps, etc., as I haven't started using any new products. I know allergies can start randomly after many years of use of the same product. Has anyone had experience with a similar situation? Should I be particularly worried about worse health ramifications other than hives? Thanks, ladies.\",\n",

In the past, I was on the normal birth control pill (Tried a few brand names, but its the general mixed hormone 3 weeks of pill 1 of placebo type), and loved it.\\n\\nThen I started getting migraine headaches with an aura and my provider took me off of it, saying I was at risk for a stroke. Yikes.\\n\\nBut I liked the idea of a pill, so I was put on the progesterone only mini-pill (4 weeks of pills, no placebo). Not awful, but I was spotting almost constantly (about the same amount of fluid as my everyday production, but it was tinted brown) and stopped getting a monthly period. This sucks: 1. wearing pads all the time and sharing the gross spotting detail with sexual partners was killer, 2. I was paranoid. My period is a monthly pregnancy test, and I just can't deal with not knowing if I'm pregnant or not. \\n\\nSo here we are. I've been told the shot is not a good option, because it will produce the same side effects as the mini pill, can anyone attest to the opposite? I've also been told no mirena because I haven't given birth, so my body is more likely to reject it. \\n\\nI'm looking for another suggestion from the community, because my provider has been largely unhelpful (She thinks I should just deal with the side effects of the mini pill or stop having sex) \",\n",

Well, I went in, got the awful numbing spray, they stuck in the stupid ruler thing (Fun fact: My uterus in 7cm deep). And then they tried **shoving in the Mirena. 3 fucking times.** Turns out I have some kind of \"ring\" around my cervix that wouldn\\'t let the Mirena go in all the way. I have a sneaking suspicion that the ring is scar tissue from some abuse from when I was a kid.\\n\\nSo after trying to shove this thing in 3 times the lady gave up and told me I have to come back next wednesday to see if the other doctor can get it in. They are charging me for both IUDs. They told me if they can\\'t get it in then they will put an Implanon in my arm, but I don\\'t even know if that will do what I want (I have really irregular bleeding and wanted Mirena for longterm protection + No periods). They will also be charging me for in implanon.\\n\\nI am so fucking pissed, I\\'ve been crying since I got off the table. I am going to get fucking hammered tonight because I have a stupid cervix that is really dumb and I don\\'t want some stupid matchstick in my arm and I don\\'t even know if it\\'s going to do what I want.\\n\\nFuck, ladies.

Took a three or four month break from that BC, and was not having periods during this time. Then I started taking the Camila, still not having periods regularly.

My gf (who I love very much) recently decided to stop taking birth control pills because they were causing acne (she's tried a few types of the pill but they all seem to do this to her). I am worried since we are in college and pregnancy would be really bad for us. I don't even mind the occasional pimple at all, but she cares a lot about it. She thinks that only using a condom is fine, but I'm not sure I want to continue having sex depending only on a thin bit of latex (she has said if she got preg she would keep it). Then again, no sex is not really practical. I really don't want a kid, but am I being too paranoid? I don't want to be an ass and demand that she take them. Should I try to convince her to not care about the acne (she already uses a bunch of anti-acne products)? \",\n",

Via google search, there's a lot of conflicting information. Some say that kava doesn't interact or that it's so mild that there's nothing to worry about (there's kava tea bars opening in the US now, for example).  Other sources say that it's known to decrease effectiveness by its effect on the liver.  And a few say probably not, but don't risk it.   I couldn't personally find anything referencing birth control and kava on PubMed.  \\n\\nI've been drinking it for a while now and had no idea.  I knew that St. John's Wort and other supplements interact, but when I looked up kava sites online before picking up some tea in Target they didn't say anything about it.  Shit.  I'm on Implanon, but with very irregular periods that make the paranoia worse.  I'm going to stop drinking it to be cautious, but having more information would be nice.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hey 2X. In an LDR and was only home for a short time (hence the sexytimes on period). I started taking Depo pills and was just finishing my first month back on them when it happened. (was on Yasmin for 4 years, it made me super hormonal and I gained +/- 25lbs so I\\'m now trying a low-dose Depo)\\n\\nThe flow was very light and started overnight but it was for sure not spotting, definitely a period flow. BF and I talked it out, decided we\\'d have sexytimes since it was light, and he came inside me. This was the morning after the period started. This is the first and only time I\\'ve ever let a guy do that. Being on the pill (I know, one month is nothing) and on my period I figured it was pretty safe. I\\'d planned to get Plan B the next day for extra precaution but had no way to get to a pharmacy.\\n\\nAnyway, after the period-sex my flow got really, really light and almost stopped for a few days. There was blood every day, some more heavy than others. I\\'m a little worried and not sure if that\\'s because of the new pill (this was first cycle on pill) or because of the sex. A few days after bleeding was \"over\" we had sex again and my flow came back in a more normal capacity. also: since I was 12 I\\'ve been getting periods so heavy that I was prescribed Oxycontin and had to use super tampons + super pads at the same time. Fuuuuun.\\n\\n**TL;DR boyfriend and I had sex during period after being on Depo for one month (full cycle) and flow almost stopped after.**\\n\\nCould I be pregnant? Has this happened to anyone before? Is this normal for period sex?\\n',\n",

When I was 19 I went on the pill for the first time and it completely wrecked my sex drive and made sex very painful, but I was young and didn't realize there were any other options. After that relationship ended I went off the pill.\\n\\nJump to now. I'm 25 and went back on the pill again this past summer. It made me completely insane. Uber bitch, emotional wreck, no sex drive, painful sex. My boyfriend begged me to go off of it because of how it affected me, so I agreed and now we just use condoms. Things have been so much better since I went off it, within a week or so it was like I was a new person.\\n\\nNow for the question... I would really like to be using some form of bc. I've considered an IUD or the depo shot but I figure it's all going to be the same, it's all going to give the same crazy reaction. I know I can keep trying different pills, but it could be years till I find the right one and I can't just be crazy until then. So help me out ladies, is there anything out there I can use that won't make me crazy?!\",\n",

For some people, and according to my doctor, this means that you don't get your period. However, on Microgynon, it only meant that I was on a 30-day cycle, and on Cilest, a 28-day cycle, and my period happened and went on for 6 days as normal on both pills. I think I have quite a heavy period and bad period pains (but not like the horror stories you hear from some people, I know), but I'm not sure. I understand that this is an individual matter and people's reactions to the pill vary from person to person, but I hoped someone here would be able to tell me - what factors affect whether your period stops or not? Is there anything I can do, or a pill generally more successful on this front that I could take to give a higher chance of my period stopping?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"So here's a bit about the back-story. About 8 months ago, I went on birth control called Loestrin. I ended up quitting it after about a month and a half of taking the pill because of some side effects that I wasn't happy about.  \\n\\nA while later, (and i'm not sure of exactly how much time, but it must have been about a week or two) I noticed a bit of white discharge. I figured it would go away, but it never did. It began to thicken and I self-diagnosed myself with my first yeast infection. It wasn't itchy, or had any of the other symptoms. Not right away, at least. But from what I could tell (thick white discharge, yeasty smell, EXTREMELY bitter taste) it was a yeast infection. I took monistat to try to fix it. It was the one day version.  \\n\\nTwo days after taking the monistat, I got my period. I wasn't getting the discharge anymore, from what I could tell, but man, was it itchy. The day after getting my period, I got a Urinary Tract Infection. I went to the doctor about it and he gave me antibiotics to fix it. He said it might just be itchy because it was going away, but to continue using the cream that the monistat came with. I did, and took the antibiotics. Everything seemed to die down a LOT after my period ended, but I still had a light white discharge, and still with the horrible taste. I tried the three day monistat the next month when it started to get worse.  \\n\\nAgain, same results. UTI and then worsens, and then calms down, but doesnt go away. The next month, I decided to just let it be and see if it went away. Again, when I got my period, the itching started.  \\n\\nI went to a gynecologist for the first time since I had gotten the birth control from them. I told them about the problem. They took a swab and gave me a single pill. They said that if it was a yeast infection, it would help. If not, they would call me and prescribe something else. I took the pill that day and waited for a call. A few days to a week later, I got the call, but we had gotten disconnected. I showed up at the office to talk to them. They said that I was right and that it was a yeast infection. I said that it had been a while and the pill still hadn't worked. They told me that they didnt know what else to tell me and to take monistat.  \\n\\nI was angry for a while, but through dumb faith and trying to make use of the last drops of hope in me, i tried the monistat again. Twice. Both times, I got another UTI.I've tried taking acidophilus, eating more yogurt, drinking cranberry juice and taking cranberry supplements, taking B vitamins, and everything else I read or could think of. It's been about 6 or 7 months since I stopped taking the pill. I had never had any kind of vaginal infection before this... Im scared, I'm tired of having it, I'm tired of trying everything. I just want everything to stop and go away. Someone please help!!! :(\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Here is some background information: About a month ago, I started going through extreme anxiety and depression along with some stomach issues, something I have never felt before in my life.  My period was about three weeks late during this time and it was going to be the first period I have had since having sex. When it finally came, most of my symptoms vanished and I was back to normal.  I was feeling great, I was eating whatever I wanted, everything was fine.  I thought it was just a hormonal thing and I moved on.\\n\\nA week ago, the symptoms started again and, although it seemed too early for my period, I was getting light cramps and a sharp pain every once in a while.  I went to the gynecologist and explained to her my symptoms, hoping she could provide me some answers.  Instead, she told me to see a therapist.  She started me on birth control as well, although she only recommended it because I am sexually active.\\n\\nI have been taking Junel fe (generic for Loestrin) since last Thursday and I'm not quite sure if the symptoms I have been feeling are from the birth control or just an extension from what I was feeling before. I have noticed a change in my mood since I have started.  I am a lot less anxious overall but I feel depressed and have been crying a lot more.  I don't even have enough energy to pretend to be happy, which I am afraid will hurt my relationship.  My moods are constantly changing, from really depressed, to content, to just feeling weird and I can never really seem to focus.\\n\\nAlright, so my question are: Is it too early to start feeling nauseous and depressed from the birth control since I have only been taking it for 5 days?  And if this is a side effect from the birth control, will it go away or at least fade over time?  I have also noticed a decrease in my libido and I was wondering if that might go away as well.\\n\\nAny advice in general would be great.  I've been kind of freaking out for the past month and I just want to relax and be calm.\",\n",

I asked the pharmacist before doing all of this, but she was just reading out of the pamphlet. It didn't say anything about *not* taking it more than once a month. Google results give mixed answers.

       "   'selftext': 'For the last nine months, my boyfriend and I have been using the fertility awareness method as contraception. We originally decided on this method as I tolerate hormonal birth control poorly, I\\'m extremely sensitive to both latex and spermicide, and I have chronic pain issues which prevent a copper IUD. \\n\\nFor the record: I\\'m 33 and divorced; my ex-husband and I tried for several years to conceive using FAM. I have PCOS so the likelihood of even conceiving is statistically lower than the failure rates on most non-hormonal BC (and let\\'s not get into the odds of making it past the first trimester). When we first decided on this method I talked it over with my doctor, who concurred that it was a sound decision based on my history.\\n\\nHowever well FAM works for me, it\\'s not working for my SO. Our sex life has been suffering as a result because he\\'s utterly paranoid that he\\'s going to get me pregnant - and no amount of explanation on how ovulatory/luteal cycles work and how charting BBT and cervical mucus and position forms a pretty clear safe/not safe picture will put him at ease. For him, there\\'s got to be \"real\" birth control, regardless of where in the cycle I\\'m in, or he\\'s just not going to have sex with me. \\n\\nCondoms aren\\'t an option because he has his own physical issues and Viagra et al is far out of our ability to afford. We\\'ve been trying to \"make do\" with other, non-PIV contact, but physical intimacy overall is becoming rarer and rarer. It\\'s starting to become a MAJOR problem in our relationship because I need that intimacy to feel connected and attractive to my partner ... and it\\'s just not happening. \\n\\nWhat do I do? My last GYN appointment I sat down with the doctor and we went over the options available in the States. All the hormonal options are out (including Depo, Nuvaring, Mirena, etc), all the barrier options are out, and the copper IUD is out. There\\'s no other options available, are there? ',\n",

I was horrifically anemic so I had to do it. Switched brands a few times to please my insurance. I switched to NuvaRing about a year ago. I've really been hitting an all time low in feeling depressed. Kinda runs in the family, but I just started realizing it could completely be my BC. I've also been completely missing my libido for the past couple years. So I'm done.\\n\\nMy question, to those of you who quit your BC, how long were you on it and about how long did it take you to feel normal again? I've read that I should give it 3-6 months, but do you think it might be longer since I've been on it for so long? Just looking for personal experiences. Thanks!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Throwaway, natch, and I don\\'t really know where to post this. Thought I\\'d start here...\\n\\nA little over a year ago, I (28) had an abortion and had the Mirena inserted. Fast forward to a month ago - during a conversation about how our bedroom activities have skidded from 5x a week to 1 or less, my boyfriend of two years (32) finally admits that his reluctance to get down is due to my lack of natural lubrication. Yes, we have lube on the nightstand - many kinds, in fact - but the fact that I don\\'t seem to get \"turned on\" on my own is *really* off-putting to him. He\\'s developed a mental block that basically makes him either dread sex or not want to have it at all. \\n\\nI did some research, drew a few conclusions, and gathered some facts:\\n\\n1. Dryness is common among the menopausal, who are experiencing a decrease in estrogen production. Estrogen is the thing that makes vag lube happen.\\n\\n2. Before my pregnancy, I was on a BC pill called Microgestin, a primary ingredient of which is estrogen.\\n\\n3. I found a few - but not many - sources saying dryness is a side effect of the IUD, specifically Mirena.\\n\\nSo I\\'m pretty comfortable saying that the dryness issue (which I had never even noticed, by the way, until he said something) is a direct result of the IUD. (But I could be wrong!)\\n\\nNow I\\'m looking for possible solutions. The first is to take out the IUD, go back on The Pill, and hope I don\\'t get pregnant (or fat) again. Or we could just stick to condoms for the next 3 or 4 years until we\\'re ready to have children... just kidding.\\n\\nThe second is to find some other way to get estrogen into my body. Menopausal women use Premarin, but I don\\'t know if this is even a viable option for someone like me. It seems like that could be dangerous.\\n\\nThe third is for him to stop being a baby, grab the Astroglide, and go to town. This would certainly be the easiest for me, but he seems put out by it.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Or can you offer some advice? Is there a 4th option I haven\\'t thought of? Should I post this somewhere else? Please help before we join the ranks of the r/deadbedrooms! ',\n",

Probably the most painful part of the ordeal is being down $700. But not getting pregnant is worth it.\\n\\n**The Insertion** Less painful overall than many shots I have received. The first shot effectively numbed my arm, and the devise slid in painlessly.\\n\\n**The Recovery** Pretty much non-existent. Took off the bandages by the time I got home from the doctors, worked out in the evening. Wore a long sleeve shirt for a few days because the area looked nasty (bruise and insertion hole).\\n\\n**The First Period** One of the better periods of my life. Still bleeding, which is an inconvenience, but no gut wrenching, vomit inducing cramps like I used to get.\\n\\n**The Feeling** Yes, I can feel it. Many websites I have been on said you would not, but I do. It is like a tag scratching at your arm, but from the inside, so you cannot adjust it. Not painful, just a near-constant awareness of it being there.\\n\\nOverall, I know it doesn't work out for some women, but so far I give it 5 stars.\\n\",\n",

I'm a week into my new cycle and I just am taking random things way too personally, like, to the point of crying personally.

I really am unhappy about spotting all the way up to my breakthru bleed. \\n\\nAs for other symptoms. I have have headaches on and off. Mild cramping occurred when the spotting started, but not really since. That's all...\\n\\nFrom what I could google I started taking Vitamin C pills to help, but with no result. I also read to decrease my caffeine intake, but I get withdrawl headaches if I don't have any, and I could not find a good explanation as to why I need to reduce my caffeine intake.\\n\\nSo am I just worried about nothing?

My once-irregular periods have been quite regular, which is comforting to a college student who certainly does not want a child at this point.

About four days before my placebo week was supposed to start, I started spotting. Not enough to require a tampon or anything, but enough to warrant wearing a pantyliner. Around the day my placebos started, the spotting tapered off. I continued to spot a little bit throughout the placebo week, but now, two days before I go back to active pills, I'm pretty much done spotting.\\n\\nMy question is this: was that my period for this month?

       "   'selftext': 'At 17 Implanon was my first form of birthcontrol. I did my research and went to see my doctor in feb. 2010. My personal physician actually did not support my decision and wanted to put me on the birth control pill, she gave me a months prescriptions to try it out. Also, my doctor was not certified to do the implanon procedure so she had to give me a list of the doctors in the area that were certified and trained. (I do not have the same doctor anymore, this one was really unhelpful)\\n\\nI got in contact with the closest doctor covered by my insurance trained to perform the procedure, she was only a few towns up. I had the first meeting with her to go through the information and plead my case. When I say plead my case I mean it, the doctor was very thorough about making sure I knew this was right for me, and this made me hesitant. But, I had done my research and her interrogating wouldn\\'t stop me. The doctor then informs me this is the first actual implant she will ever be doing. She has practiced before but I am her first implanon patient. I\\'m scared by this, but trust her. She is very smart and just wants to make sure I\\'m making the right choice. I guess being a teenager made me seem like I make impulse decisions? I wasn\\'t, this is something I was very prepared for and needed. \\n\\nNext appointment I came in to get the implant (march 2010), the nurse working with us was very frightened of needles (wtf?) and kept saying things like \"i would never do this\" and \"wow thats a big needle\" and \"does it hurt?\" I found this TERRIBLE. She shouldn\\'t have acted in a way that makes me feel regretful of my decisions, but the nurse didn\\'t shake me either. I knew that this birth control was right for me. \\n\\nI\\'m not afraid of needles and the worst pain I felt was getting the novocain into my arm. I decided not to watch as they did the procedure, but I felt pressure. No blood, no pain. Put my coat on and drove myself home with one arm to steer the wheel. \\n\\nAfter the novocain went away my arm was a little sore and probably the worst pain was sleeping with that arm underneath my head, I just had to switch sides. It was not difficult. There was bruising for awhile around the implant and looked very bad, yellow/blue/green bruising but it didn\\'t feel painful. \\n\\nWent back for a checkup and everything is going smoothly. There was just one thing \\'wrong\\' with my implant: the shot was injected farther underneath the skin than necessary (making the actual implant about 3/4 of an inch away from the actual shot injection scar). This is just a visual thing, it in no way is to my detriment, I could care less. \\nAlso, my doctor had informed me that since my procedure she has done another girl\\'s implant and had another girl very interested in it. \\n\\n\\nAlso, I went to college and met my woman\\'s studies\\' teacher who also has implanon. She is a mother of two, I am not. We both find it equally rewarding. \\n\\n**Any questions or concerns?** I really just want to promote Implanon. I am so happy this birth control exists. Other forms of birthcontrol are just not nearly as good, as an on campus student I have no way of regularly going to CVS or the doctor for my monthly no-baby-tax. ',\n",

Up until recently I had to switch doctors and due to some money issues ended up going to a sliding fee scale clinic. The clinician there could not give me the same brand because they didn't have it, so she gave me a brand called Aviane. She said that this brand was VERY similar to Zenchent. ( I was worried because I have had weight gain issues on all other brands other than Zenchent)\\n\\nAnyways the clinician tells me that I need to wait 1-2 weeks before having unprotected sex with this new brand of pills. She told me to finish the rest of my Zenchent pills and then start the new pack of Aviane on the following sunday, since I'm a sunday starter. \\n\\nEverything was going fine until tonight I had unprotected sex. (not intentionally, the condom broke :/) I take my pills at 8PM everyday, I am never late. So the problem is, I'm only on the second day of this new pack/brand of pills and I'm scared that since I didn't wait the full 1-2 weeks, I could be at risk for pregnancy. I did some research on Plan B and was thinking about picking it up if I am indeed at risk. It's 50 dollars at the pharmacy, but I'm willing to pay that, need be. My main conflict is whether or not I should go ahead and buy Plan B, or wait to see if I get my period since the clinician said that these two brands of pills were very similar and maybe I'm just overreacting. \\n\\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Now I am dealing with a side effect I wasn't even aware could occur - hair thinning, especially around the scalp area. \\n\\nI have been researching it a little bit and it seems like this is mostly a side effect of lo-estrogen pills. Has anyone been in this situation? Would switching to a higher estrogen pill help (and I hope reverse) the effects, such as regular ortho-tricyclen? What could be some other side effects of increasing the estrogen dose? Should I just go out and by some hair-thickening products to combat the side effects? I've tried talking to my dr. about this and he's very dismissive of my concerns, but it's messing with my self confidence and I want to take control of the situation. \\n\\nI am so glad I found this subreddit. I've read through many of the other posts and you guys seem like a great support and resource. Thanks for any advice. \\n\\nEdit: I am 21 y/o \",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hi all. This may be a silly question...but as I'm in no position to get pregnant, I figure it's worth asking. \\n\\nI've been taking Loestrin for the past month and so far no problems concerning its efficiency (I've been taking it as recommended and I'm now on my period). \\n\\nMy concern is, I'm not able to store my medication at room temperature constantly and I'm not sure whether or not that is going to affect it. It says to store it at 77 degrees F, and is permitted to reach temperatures between 59 degrees - 86 degrees F.\\n\\n The issue is, my dorm room is HORRIBLY insulated. I have an entire wall that is lined with windows, so around this time of year my room can get incredibly cold. I don't have a thermometer, so I can't measure exactly...but it certainly goes below 59 degrees. When I'm in the room, I try to keep the heat on as much as possible to maintain a normal temperature, but my room mate and I are out of the room most of the day, so it gets cold. \\n\\nI'm just very nervous that since the medication is spending so much time below the recommended temperature, it's going to decrease in effectiveness. I've done a fair amount of research, but I haven't really found anything useful. Any insight that you can provide would be awesome! Thank you all so much!\",\n",

I'm also pretty good about taking my birth control, I didn't miss any pills this pack and I took most of them at the same time (there were a couple I had to take a few hours later because I didn't have them with me at the time).

       "   'selftext': \"Hi there. I kind of have a unique problem. Recently I got the courage to go to the gyno and they prescribed me with Levora to regulate my period. I'm not taking it for birth control reasons, because I am not sexually active; but someday I would like to have sex when the time is right for me. I was recommended it because my cycle is irregular and unpredictable, and I get heavy bleeding and cramping. \\n\\nWhen I read the directions it said to take it the same time every day. I have a sleep disorder that shifts my sleep/wake time every day a few hours forward. I was officially diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome but I'm starting to think I have Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder. I started taking the pill at 9 pm every day, thinking that was a safe time, but as my sleep phase has shifted I can't even wake up until at least midnight now. I'm worried about its loss of effectiveness in regulating my period with my inability to take the pill at the right time. If I ever decided to have sex I want the pill to be as effective as it can be. I started setting my alarm to wake up to take the pill but I find that my quality of sleep has gone down dramatically in order to do so. I feel sicker and more drowsy during my waking hours when I interrupt my sleep to take the pill. \\n\\nI'm starting to think it's just not worth it to take birth control pills. I'm starting to think it's better to endure pain than to feel sick from sleep loss. Maybe I should just suck it up and deal with the pain and irregularity and bleeding. I know IUDs exist, and I'm allergic to copper. I know plastic ones exist, but after researching them, they freak me out too much...thanks to my phobia of medical devices. Haha, I feel like a fucked up, broken human being. It's funny because I'm about ready to accept menstrual pain and eternal virginity. Well, I was going to ask for advice about this, but now I feel like shit. \",\n",

I started on Portia, then switched to a 3 month kind similar to Seasonale, but recently switched back to Portia because I was having a lot of break through bleeding with the 3 month kind. \\n\\nNow, I very rarely want to have sex. Generally, I just don't feel like it. (Obviously, this is putting a strain on our relationship) I wish that I did. I am attracted to my boyfriend and he is quite good when it comes to performing sexually. I'm concerned that my lack of sex drive is related to the change in birth control. I have also been carrying more weight than normal around my thighs/hips/stomach which makes me feel rather insecure (I'm working on that too, although I can't help but think the BC is making loosing this weight more difficult). I should also mention that while sex is enjoyable with him, I never climax (at least I don't think - I'm not convinced I ever have...). \\n\\nI did take this brand of BC previously when we first started dating and didn't notice a problem. However, it was a brand new relationship at that point - still in the infatuation stage so maybe the lust counteracted the BC? Idk. I'm not sure if a type of BC can have varying effects on one person....? \\n\\nAnyway, are other forms of BC less likely to impact sex drive? Like I said, I WANT to want to have sex...So I'm kind of confused and the pill seems like the logical cause. I want to stay on some for of BC, for sure...Any suggestions/Insight? Thanks!\\n\\n\",\n",

I've been on Yaz for a year now, and just ran out of my last pack of pills. I tried calling two different planned parenthood branches around here, and one told me I needed a pelvic exam but they had no appts till April. When I told her that I needed my scrip refilled soon because I'm still on my period but only have so much time to pick up taking my pills, she offered no assistance. I called the PP in Plainfield and was told that they could do a birth control consultation but that the doctor refuses to prescribe Yaz. It didn't occur to me to ask if he could prescribe Gianvi, the generic form. \\n\\nI'm worried because I don't have much time left, my old physician won't prescribe me new pills because they want me to physically come in and I can't drive 4 hours just to get an exam and a prescription nor afford their exorbitant exam costs. I've tried other bc pills in the past, but Yaz helps my PMDD and the others made my hormones wacky and I gained like 30 lbs on Lo-estrin and Ortho. I want to drive to the PP in Manville tomorrow to see if they'll just help me figure out SOMETHING, is there anything else you can recommend?\",\n",

I figured it was probably a combination of leading a high-stress life (the glamour of grad school and all) and just poor eating/exercise (though I guess 150 lbs isn't too bad for someone who's 5'9).  My doctor said I have an underactive thyroid and high testosterone, so she put me on Levothyroxine and Kariva.  Unfortunately, my doctor did not really have the chance to explain to me what any of this means (though I've gathered that my mild hypothyroidism is probably the cause of my low energy and weight gain.. but I have absolutely no idea what the high testosterone means).\\n\\nI'm halfway through my 3rd week of Kariva and I've been on the Levothyroxine for about 3 weeks.  I experienced initial cramping, but I assumed that would go away with time.  At this point, I'm so hungry and thirsty all the time--but I find that I get nauseous very easily and quite frequently (a new development).  I also feel like I'm unbearable to be around and just about everything makes me cry--I either love everyone or I want to kill all of humanity and it's very difficult to keep my feelings in check (it's getting more difficult to refrain from making nasty comments or showing my anger).  Now that I'm nearing the last week of my pill pack, I am absolutely useless.  I am beyond exhausted all the time and can't find the motivation to pick up and study for finals.\\n\\n*Is what I'm experiencing relatively normal for just starting birth control?\\n\\n*Any suggestions on how to get my mojo back in time for finals or how to control my emotional rollercoaster?\\n\\n*Will it eventually even out?\\n\\n*Any advice/information on hypothyroidism and high testosterone?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nEdit: Grammar and formatting.\",\n",

Has anyone else with depression found hormonal birth control's of certain types made it worse? if so what did you switch to? an IUD? another form of birth control?  I'm planning a doctor's visit and would like to go in informed and have some sort of plan, thank you :)\\n\\n\\nedit: after looking at the fda pages for both types of BC pill they have identical amounts of active ingredients, also i have been on the new pill for about eight months.\",\n",

I knew that it helped with severe symptoms with PMS/PMDD, but I wasn't sure if what I had counted as severe enough. It wasn't until my sister's started taking (followed by my sister taking it) it that I realized the problems that matched mine were much more manageable/not even there. The problem is I don't know much about hormonal birth control in terms of different types. I learned a lot about hormonal birth control in general, but that is it.\\n\\nSide possible problem, I know my mom would be a little weary of me taking bc. It is not because she thinks I will sleep around, but because my cousin got blood clots in her lungs taking Yaz. The difference between my sis and I is that I take other meds, and she doesn't. My mom needs to know my medications because I am on a few and if something happens where I am unable to answer, she can easily read off everything I take. Soo...any advice on that front as well?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Originally I posted this in Two X Chromosomes but no one is commenting, perhaps I will get a response or opinion from people here.. (original post: http://redd.it/qoh8h)\\n\\nI have a thought, that is mine and mine alone. It is my own personal opinion, so do me a favor, humor me and read it please. Or don’t that is up to you.. Let\\'s pretend there is no such thing as STD\\'s, let\\'s pretend that all women wait until marriage to have sex and birth control never existed.. I know, I know.. Just hear me out and let\\'s just pretend. Close your eyes for two minutes, really clear your thoughts and think there is no such thing as STD\\'s or STI\\'s, ALL women wait until marriage, and there is no such thing as birth control.. Ok now that you did that… Let’s begin shall we? Yay! Wedding day comes; you have sex for the first time, and let\\'s pretend BAM! You\\'re pregnant!!! YAY!!! You give birth to a beautiful and healthy child.. Congratulations! A few months pass by and you and your husband have sex again.. Bam! You\\'re pregnant again. Congratulations! Another healthy and beautiful child. Two amazing and wonderful blessings.. ! A few more months pass by and you and your husband have sex again.. Bam! You\\'re pregnant again. Congratulations! Amazing another healthy and beautiful child. Three amazing and wonderful blessings.. Now keep thinking about this pattern.. Sex is a wonderful, beautiful, healthy, normal and intimate act. Is a woman really supposed to be forced into getting pregnant every time her and her husband want to be intimate? What happens to the couple who wants to have sex but doesn\\'t want to be having 19 kids and counting (no offense to the wonderful woman of 19 kids and counting, who\\'s choice I respect and give her a standing ovation for raising that many amazing and well behaved children). But for most of us that is not what we want, that is not an option! And it\\'s unrealistic to think it would be. Now what about woman who have medical problems that have been advised not to have children because it could kill them or can pass on fatal hereditary conditions to their unborn child but they are able to reproduce still? What about the girl who has made the decision to have sex and uses a condom and it breaks? What about the girl who NEVER wants children but cannot have her tubes tide because she is too young? What about the girls who are anemic? What about girls who have their periods every few days, weeks, or months? What about the mom who has three children she loves dearly but can\\'t afford or/and doesn\\'t want more? The girl who is raped? The drunk couple who didn\\'t use a condom but thought they did? What about the girl who is in an abusive relationship and her partner is trying to bully her into it? That is why I support the birth control pill or any other means of contraceptives (Nuva ring, IUD, patch, condoms.. etc.) Maybe the people who are against birth control for whatever reason, who have every right to have that opinion and to express that opinion, (just like we are allowed to support birth control, have the right to take it and express it), maybe those people and everyone else who is against it should think about the things I mentioned in my \"rant\". If they take all those thoughts of mine and really think about it could it or would it make a difference? Would they accept our reasons for wanting it? Will they keep their opinion and force us out of ours? Or will they personally refrain from using it and respect our decision to use it? Who knows maybe some will change their mind, or maybe they won’t! And maybe some people who were for it will start changing their opinion.. Who knows.. I understand that if someone doesn\\'t want to partake in using birth control for religious or personal beliefs that they have that right 100% without a doubt! I support them and will stand by their right and decision to do so!!! With that said, I want my right to take my birth control and have my opinion of wanting to do so, (for whatever the reason) be respected as well! What about God? If we are going to talk about God here.. (please forgive me and don’t take this in a wrong) but God gave us freedom of choice! ALL OF US!!! He never said what we are to do with it and he didn\\'t give us restrictions on it.. He gave us the right to think for ourselves and choose for ourselves. He didn’t give it to a few people, He didn’t give it to one person.. No, He gave it to us all!! He gave it to us so that we can make mistakes, (no I am not saying taking the pill is a mistake, it was a great and amazing invention) and learn from it. He gave it to us to experience different things and emotions. He gave it to us in kindness and out of love. It is not for you nor I to question His decision! We are only to follow our hearts and do what we feel is right and best for us! Not be judging or cruel or force our opinions on others. But this is just how I feel, I could be wrong.. But who really knows? (No one).\\n Plus think about how many children are up for adoption and aren\\'t being adopted? Every child has the right to a family, to be loved and wanted!!! It\\'s sad to see that there are so many unwanted children out there. Do we really want to help contribute to that? Really? I don’t and I hope and pray that they will all find a loving homes… but that may never happen. Not to mention there are parts of the world that are over populated and the world in general is over populating. What do we do when it’s full? We only have the one Earth to live on. Plus it does decrease the abortion numbers. Less people having unwanted pregnancies! Which is worst, the prevention of pregnancy or the termination of one? (Just an FYI: I am PRO-CHOICE it is a woman’s body and her choice to do whatever she feels is right with it and I will support anyone to have the right to a safe abortion.. but that’s a COMPLETELY different topic and for another time).\\n I can go on and on and on about this and so much more... But in the end all I want to say is: I respect you\\'re not wanting to take or use any or certain forms of birth control for whatever the reason may be and I will stand by you and support your right to do so... But please respect mine and everyone who is like me who wants the right to take birth control for whatever the reason. Please refrain from implying I am a whore or and refrain from putting me down for wanting my rights and opinions to be respected as well. Same goes for all the Pro-Birth Control people, stop saying these people or uneducated or living in a different time!!! I feel like this has turned into a “name calling game”. It seems like it’s all about the “she’s a prude”, or the “she’s a whore” thing. How about all stand together and agree to disagree and leave the birth control option to each individual to decide for themselves without being pushed or forced into any kind of decision or in any direction. There is no right or wrong in this matter it is all a personal opinion just like this is mine. So let’s have respect for all Women and give them the right to choose what is best for themselves and respect their choice!!! With all that said I meant to offend no one, I just needed to let it out and get it off my chest. I hope you respect that. Blessed Be! ',\n",

My boyfriend and I have been combining this with withdrawal and/or condoms, but we've found both pretty inconvenient and have talked about going without.\\n\\nSo what I'm wondering is: is the effectiveness of the pill strongly undermined if he doesn't pull out?

After trying to find out more about it I can only assume he was referring to the Gynefix which is an IUD more suitable for those whose uterus is abnormally shaped or too small for the standard IUD, is \"frameless\" and adheres to a women\\'s unique cervical shape. (I might not have that precisely, so don\\'t quote me.) From what I read Europe, China and it seems Canada have had this wonderful device for years but due to the FDA and \"lack of IUD use in the US\" it has yet to be approved since Gynefix submitted for it way back in 1999. After trying to be fitted twice for the Paraguard and Mirena IUD it was clear my uterus wasn\\'t going to allow it as I have not had a child and was told my uterus is too small. For the most part I cannot take hormones so, pretty screwed on the contraception front. I\\'m not finding any info on when exactly this might be coming to the states and am hoping there might be some redditor\\'s out there who might know a thing or two. I will definitely get in back in touch with my doctor to try to find out more about it. Also, I live pretty close to Canada and have read a few blogs about woman actually traveling there to get this device.\\n\\nWhy do we only have two options of this form of contraceptive in the US? I highly doubt it has to do with a lack of interest. Experiences?\\n',\n",

I was frustrated. The brand I take (ortho tri-cyclen lo) at one point had a generic equivalent but it has since been taken off the market; I don't have many other options because this pill works quite well for me and it seems like I would be taking my health in my hands trying to fiddle around trying to find a cheaper but just as effective pill. When I mentioned how much I was getting charged for my b.c. (90$ co-pay for 3 months, the price without insurance I believe is closer to 200$ but I could be a little off the mark) he was astonished. He told me these little pills cost mere cents to make. \\n\\nSo my questions are:\\n- What are some possible reasons my co-pay has increased?\\n- Does the pill really cost so little to make? I've been googling around and can't seem to find an answer to the initial cost of the pill.\\n- What drives the cost up so much? I imagine it has something to do with the 'big pharmaceutical companies' but if anyone can be more specific I'd appreciate it. \\n- Why would the generic option have been taken off the market? \\n\\n**tl;dr:** My gynecologist says my pill costs pennies to make, but I pay 90$ for three packs.

On my first pack of pills, I spotted for about two weeks and then had a three day period during the placebo pills. I'm on my second pack of pills now. Starting at the end of the first month of pills (January) I started spotting and I haven't stopped except for a week in February. It's that rusty colored blood and only bright red as of a couple days ago. It's the middle of March AND I AM STILL BLEEDING. I still have another week to go before I take my placebos.  I have had unprotected sex, Valentine's weekend and the first weekend of March (long distance boyfriend), but since the bleeding is constant I'm not inclined to believe I'm pregnant.  \\n\\nAt first I loved not having a period and being able to forgo protection, but now it's just annoying.\\n\\nSo what I'm asking is am I taking too low of a dosage? Or what else could be my problem? My gyno doesn't take patients when they're bleeding and lives an hour and a half away, so making an appointment is near impossible when I never stop bleeding and I don't have a car.

Already had my follow up and everything was good, but my period was like a week and a half early, question 1 is that normal?\\n\\nQuestion 2 what was your period like pre and post paragard? I realize everyone is different but was just curious.\\n\\nQuestion 3 did you experience cramps pre/post paragard? This is the first period where I have had cramps, which leads to...\\n\\nQuestion 4, did your cramps and/or period get less intense after a few months of having the paragard?\\n\\nFinally, sorry so many questions, numero cinco: did you have trouble finding your strings while on your period? I know the cervix and uterus change position and such during different times in your cycle but I could feel the strings one day and then the next day nothing. I know it is still probably up there and I am just freaking myself out but some reassurance would be nice. I'm just waiting for my damn period to end already so my cervix/uterus goes back into a position that I can feel my strings, going on day 7 today.\\n\\nOh and just so you know I do plan on calling my doctor if my period ends and I can't find the strings. I just know my cervix is lower than normal because I had sex the other night and could feel my partner hitting my cervix which doesn't normally happen (my first time having sex on my period).\\n\\nThanks in advance ladies.\",\n",

I asked her about the BC and she says there are days where she might have been inconsistent with time but not too far off and might have been a day where she missed one and took two the next day as it says on the pack. Besides her being late, she gave me detail that there was only one small drop of blood and she has been feeling the symptoms of a period but just no blood.\\n\\nI read online for what might have caused the missed period besides pregnancy (stress, lack of sleep, increased activity, etc.) she has been stressed, lack of sleep, began to workout, but she has done and experienced this before but she never really missed a period. Also, she told me she didn't take her last pill right before her period because she expected to be on her period. She told me that information for the possibility of it disrupting her cycle. \\n\\nShe also took a pregnancy test today and it came out negative, but I read so much online that I know I can't just go by a pregnancy test.\\n\\nAny information would be helpful.

       "   'selftext': \"I recently started having sex with my boyfriend (both 21). We have used condoms consistently throughout this time but I am nevertheless extremely paranoid about pregnancy - especially after I started my period two weeks late last month, which was quite frankly terrifying. \\n\\n\\nI've been taking cerazette, the mini-pill (using in conjunction with condoms) for three weeks but have had really bad side effects. Though I eat healthily and do a lot of strenuous sport, I've bloated up noticeably and my skin has broken out. These things I could normally deal with. However, I have a history of anxiety disorders (GAD, SAD) and depression, for which I have previously been medicated. For the last year or so I have been in an extremely good and stable place emotionally. Being on cerazette has made me anxious, paranoid, and weepy to the point where I'm crying on a daily basis. I don't like feeling as though I'm trapped in the body of an acne-ridden, bloated, hysterical stranger. I don't like the lack of control. \\n\\n\\nI can't take the combined pill because once, in 2005, I had a migraine with aura. \\n\\n\\nAs such, my non-cerazette hormonal options, such as the implant, will likely affect me in the same way as cerazette. \\n\\n\\nWill these cerazette side-effects wear off or die down? Because if not, I am not interested. \\n\\n\\nI've been looking at the copper IUD. Despite the minor risks, the fact that it is long-lasting, non-hormonal, and doesn't require a daily or by-encounter commitment makes me want to try it. However, I realise I may have difficulties finding someone to fit it, as I have never been pregnant/had children. I live in the UK, if anyone has had experiences getting a copper IUD here I'd love to hear them! \\n\\n\\nOther options I've looked at have been the diaphragm (which you don't really hear much about!) and the Mirena IUS. Using a diaphragm seems like a bit of a hassle, but as I already use a menstrual cup, I imagine I could get used to it. The Mirena worries me, as it's the same hormones as cerazette - however, as they're applied locally, there might be fewer side-effects? \\n\\n\\nMy only real concern with the IUD (despite finding someone to fit it) is the effect it has on periods. Mine are fairly painful/heavy already, but I have a long-standing prescription of mefenamic acid to deal with it. Further to that, I only get cramps on the first day of my period, after which I tend to be cramp-free, with a manageable flow. I'm not particularly keen to signing up to a week of menstrual horror, which the IUD seems to entail! \\n\\n\\nAnyway, if I could hear some advice, or some people's experiences with these forms of birth control which aren't stories of unmitigated horror (though those are welcome too!) I'd be incredibly grateful. \",\n",

My period started a week before I reached the placebo pills and, instead of stopping after 5-6 days as it normally does, it continued to just kind of hang on until the end of my placebo week, meaning I had a full 14-day period. I hoped that it was just a fluke and things would return to normal, but it happened again the next month. Started early, ran for 14 days. Now, it is happening again. I'm still 6 days away from starting my placebo pills, but my period started 2 days ago and I fully believe it will go for the 14-16 days up until my placebo week is done.

On Sunday night I had spotting different than the usual spotting and more like period spotting with little mucus bits in it. By morning it was gone. Next day same thing happened right before I go to bed I see spotting and its gone by morning.

I have had unprotected sex (after the IUD was in) with my monogamous boyfriend though so i'm a bit worried. Also at this point I just want my PMS to stop so my hormones and therefor my brain will settle down and relax. I know for some people anything longer than a three day PMS might not sound like much but for somebody who can have a panic attack triggered by the sound of the TV being to loud its no walk in the park for me. Its hard enough dealing with everyday situations let alone hormonal induced mood swings. I was just wondering if any users had any similar experiences or any advice.\\nI'm going to give it in till the 10th to see if my cycle syncs up then call planed parenthood.\",\n",

We used condoms but things were a bit... messy, so I made sure to take emergency birth control the next day. I felt fine at the time, but since starting the ring I've been exhausted, nauseous, and a bit headachey.\\n\\nCould taking EC right before starting a hormonal birth control exacerbate the side effects? I'm really hoping its that and not just the ring, as no other method will really work out for me right now, for various reasons. One way or another, do effects like this usually stick around or fade with time?\\n\\nThanks for your help!\",\n",

Acne was/is also a problem.\\n\\nWell, I see my gyno each year. I was on the pill for several years, then switched to the ring for I think 2 years, then last year I went to the pill again. After the most recent appointment, I decided to go back on the nuvaring. \\n\\nSince then, my pms has been unbearable. My nuvaring is doing fine with the actual control of birth, but nothing else. I haven't had pms this bad since before I started bc. My  parents put me on it because I'm honestly hard to be around without it, so now my boyfriend is experiencing the horror.\\n\\nAny experience with this? Should I make an appointment before my annual (december) to switch? What would be a good choice? Thanks!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"The past year I was living abroad and using Diane 35, a pill not available in the US, that completely cleared up my previously mild but very persistent acne. When I came back to the US, I asked my gynecologist for something similar available here. She told me there wasn't any pill that was exactly the same, so she tried to find something similar. She originally prescribed one pill (sorry, I don't remember the name), but then decided Safyral (aka Yasmin) would be cheaper and just as effective. I've been using it for about half a month now and my acne has returned. Does anyone know if there's a pill out there that's known to be better at controlling acne? Or does it vary too much from person to person to say what will work for me? If so, will using the pill that's closest to the one I used before be more likely to yield positive results? Or can even a minor change mean it probably won't have the same effect?\\n\\nAlso, it may be worth noting that I have polycystic ovary syndrome, which is often associated with acne. \",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hey all, my gf and I have been dating a year now. We regularly use condoms. I\\'d like to have her go on birth control but I\\'m not sure how to ask. She\\'s the sort of person that doesn\\'t like taking medicine for a headache because of \"side effects\".\\n\\nEvery time I bring up the idea of bc, she instantly says no because she thinks the side effects from it outweigh the benefits. She thinks it will effect her body badly. In the past, we had an \"oops\" and she took the morning after pill. It ended up completely bypassing her period for that month. So I guess she\\'s right in a way that it might effect her body badly. I\\'m trying to not be pushy about it at all. We are not so dilligent on always using a condom, and it\\'s going to bite us in the butt sooner or later which makes me nervous. I\\'m trying to be more dilligent on wrapping up right away. But sometimes we just get started and 10minutes in I finally put one on. Which is not good. \\n\\nI was wondering if anyone could give some advice on convincing her politely that it\\'s worthwhile. Or at least trying it out or being open to alternitives. ',\n",
